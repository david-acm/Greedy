# Be Welcome!

Greedy is a simple online dice game. I developed to serve as a sample for the following practices / patters:

* Event Sourcing & CQRS
* Test Driven Development
* Clean Architecture
* Event Modelling

The game is developed as a .Net WebApi and Blazor server apps. You will find:

* The source code in src/ with the application and service layers of the solution
* The tests/ folder covers unit tests, integration tests for the WebApi, and e2e tests for the UI.
